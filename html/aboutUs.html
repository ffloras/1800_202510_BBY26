        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>

            animals are treated with kindness and respect. We are a non-profit dedicated to rescuing, caring for,

            Our team is passionate about building stronger bonds between pets and people through adoption, education, and community support.

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                Paws & Homes began as a small initiative by a group of friends who 
                couldn’t bear to see animals suffering on the streets. 
                What started as a tiny rescue operation in a local garage has grown into a network of care facilities dedicated to animal welfare. 
                Today, we proudly operate:
