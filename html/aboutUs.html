        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Paws & Homes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our project, Paws & Homes, is created as a part of BCITâ€™s Comp 1800 projects course and is centered around the theme of supporting a growing community. 
            We chose to create a web application  that connects pet owners needing to rehome their pets with those looking to adopt because we found that there is 
            no dedicated platform that facilitates this process. We were given 14 weeks to plan and create an app that addresses this need.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Paws & Homes, users can choose whether they are interested in adopting or rehoming a pet. Those looking to rehome can post a profile of their 
            pet for potential adopters to view. Users looking to adopt can browse pet postings and send contact requests to the owners of the pets they are interested in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to provide more meaningful communication between pet owners and adopters. Pet owners receiving contact requests from users interested in 
            adopting their pet can view relevant information about those users. Only once they decide that a user is an appropriate fit for their pet and agree to 
            the request, will  both parties' contact information be visible to each other. This feature helps create appropriate matches and also ensures that 
            contact information is kept confidential. 
        </p>
